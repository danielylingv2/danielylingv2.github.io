I"ò%<p>I serve as an Alumni Interviewer for <a href="https://admission.princeton.edu/">Princetonâ€™s Undergraduate Admissions Office</a>, interviewing applicants to Princeton and writing evaluations for use in undergraduate admissions decisions.</p>

<p>My father (Xinsheng Ling) grew up in Wuhan and my mother (Hongyu Zhao) grew up in Zhengzhou. Upon graduating from college, they decided to make the giant leap of immigrating to the U.S. (for the first time in their lineages) together for their graduate studies at the University of Connecticut. The U.S. embraced them with open arms and opportunity, and for that I am quite devoted to U.S.-China relations and intercultural understanding. Formerly an invited ambassador for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ameson_Education_and_Cultural_Exchange_Foundation">Ameson Foundation</a>, as a <a href="http://ameson.org/17-english/ameson-projects?start=9">U.S. Presidential Scholar</a>.</p>
