I"ë<p>John F. Kennedy saw his health problems not as a deterrent to becoming president but as a challenge he enjoyed overcoming. Kennedy never lost sight of the limitations and frustrations that presidents often face. He wrote in 1963 that â€œEvery president must endure a gap between what he would like and what is possible.â€ Kennedy also made note of FDRâ€™s observation that Lincoln was often sad because â€œhe couldnâ€™t get it all at once. And nobody can.â€  Kennedy remained steadfast to his larger hopes and goals - less poverty in America, better race relations, and improved East-West relations. However, he noted that it was the immediate daily challenges that stood in the way of the more overarching designs and larger priorities.</p>
