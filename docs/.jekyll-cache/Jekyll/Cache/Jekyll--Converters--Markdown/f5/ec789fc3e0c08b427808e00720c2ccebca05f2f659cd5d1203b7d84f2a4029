<p>Hey friends,</p>

<p>It feels so good to hear a speech from a (soon-to-be) U.S. President that actually sounds presidential. We’ve missed this the past four years. Finally, decency, character, integrity, and honor is coming back to the White House.</p>

<p>Have a great week!<br />

<ol>
  <li>Excited to see <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/01/politics/rhode-island-providence-plantations-ballot-question/index.html">this name change</a>.</li>
  <li>This was a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/opinion/trump-election-lies.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage">great op-ed</a> in the New York Times.</li>
  <li>I loved VP-elect Kamala Harris’ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/Kamala-Harris-speech-transcript.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage">victory speech</a>. She had a great quote: “Dream with ambition, lead with conviction, and see yourselves in a way that others may not, simply because they’ve never seen it before.”</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="things-im-trying-out">Things I’m trying out</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I’m meditating first thing in the morning after waking up, as well as right before bed before sleeping. I’ve found it to be a nice way of both starting and capping off the day.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="stuff-thats-on-my-mind">Stuff that’s on my mind</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I think a lot of people tend to not approve or believe in something, simply because they haven’t seen it before. Precedent is hard to ignore. But it’s important to have a healthy belief in things that might be perceived as impossible. You be the one to break barriers. It goes back to this mental framework that I think is life-changing - having a “Why Not You” mindset, versus a “Who Are You” mindset.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="quote-of-the-week">Quote of the week</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I’ll have the honor of serving with a fantastic Vice President…Kamala Harris, who makes history as the first woman,..the first daughter of immigrants ever elected in this country. Don’t tell me it’s not possible in the United States.” - Joe Biden</p>
