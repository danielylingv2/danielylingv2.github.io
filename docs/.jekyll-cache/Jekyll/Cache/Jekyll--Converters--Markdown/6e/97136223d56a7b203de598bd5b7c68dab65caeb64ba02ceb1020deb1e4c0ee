<p><em>Every Sunday, I write a quick newsletter to share some thoughts, things I‚Äôve learned, and a few of my favorite things from the week. Enjoy!</em></p>

<p>Hey friends,</p>

<p>I‚Äôm in the middle of an exciting fellowship to build moonshot technologies and tackle some big research questions that can hopefully help solve some of the world‚Äôs hardest problems around some of humanity‚Äôs most pressing issues. Some areas of research and venture-building include COVID-19 response, pandemic prevention, AI, systems biology, and quantum computing. Feel free to ping me at daniel.ling@lrc.systems if you‚Äôre interested in contributing to a venture I‚Äôm building geared towards the development of novel vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

<p>Have a great week!<br />
Daniel</p>

<ol>
  <li>I love <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2020/09/rhode-island-photos/616489/?fbclid=IwAR0SSoP6JYuUoD_2mE-7JDTzBfisbVnb3S3ZKoG9CzffA_ER93gZ1Bm14Qc">this piece</a> in <em>The Atlantic</em> that features some of the beautiful scenery in RI.</li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/jaltma/status/1310638209622188037">This</a> was a great tweet by Jack Altman.</li>
  <li>Excited that the podcasting medium <a href="https://twitter.com/MichelleObama/status/1311308682848800769">is becoming</a> more and more prevalent.</li>

<h3 id="things-im-trying-out">Things I‚Äôm trying out</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I‚Äôm working on compressing my productivity while increasing my efficiency. I think getting more done, faster, in a compressed amount of time, is more desirable, versus spreading out your productivity over a longer period of time, with lesser efficiency throughout.</li>
  <li>Prioritizing sleep - it‚Äôs vital to be well-rested.</li>
  <li>I‚Äôm thinking about putting my writing on Substack too, to allow for email subscriptions so people can get my writing sent directly to their inbox. Let me know if this is of interest to you all.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="stuff-thats-on-my-mind">Stuff that‚Äôs on my mind</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I think it‚Äôs important to reflect on the content we consume and the days we have, instead of just consuming. Reflection is an important process.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="quote-of-the-week">Quote of the week</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúI will live in the present. I will push myself as hard as I can every day. I will pack a bit less and endure a bit more.
I will sometimes do things that don‚Äôt make sense.
I will drive from Alaska to Argentina on the Pan-American Highway with someone I love. And we will take turns driving.
I will go to bed exhausted.‚Äù - Rishi Chandna</p>
