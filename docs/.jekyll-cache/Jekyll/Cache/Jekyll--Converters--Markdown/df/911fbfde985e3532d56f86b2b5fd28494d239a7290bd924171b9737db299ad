I"Y<p>From the crop of aspiring high school students Iâ€™ve tutored that are applying to colleges, many have voiced concerns in regards to getting the rejection decision of one school, what that may mean for their other applications, and how to read into it. My advice is - please do not worry about one admission decision. Never give up hope.</p>
