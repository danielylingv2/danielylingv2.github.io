<p>I studied the mathematics track at Princeton as an undergrad. I placed out of introductory classes (100/101, etc.) in my department and began taking upper-level economic theory and applied math coursework starting in my freshman year. I completed additional coursework in physics and game theory. In my sophomore year in 2013, I published an applied math paper, applying a first-passage-time distribution model to biological systems, in the Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter, currently cited 45 times. My senior thesis in applied math was on asymmetric information and mechanism design theory (thesis advisor: Professor Stephen E. Morris). I graduated with distinction in my field in May 2016.</p>
