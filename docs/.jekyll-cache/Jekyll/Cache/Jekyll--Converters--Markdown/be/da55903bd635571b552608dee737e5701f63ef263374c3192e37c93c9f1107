<p><em>Every Sunday, I write a quick newsletter to share some thoughts, things I’ve learned, and a few of my favorite things from the week. Enjoy!</em></p>

<p>Hey friends,</p>

<p>Hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving weekend. I made a list of the things I’m thankful for, which I think is a great practice in general. In the morning portion of my daily journal that I fill out every day, I write out three things I’m grateful for - I find that it adds a nice bit of perspective before diving into the day’s work. Plus, studies suggest that there are a host of benefits that come with maintaining a gratitude journal of some sort. It’s a nice activity and habit to get into.</p>

<p>Have a great week!<br />
Daniel</p>

<h3 id="things-that-resonated-with-me-this-week">Things that resonated with me this week</h3>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/28/obituaries/tony-hsieh-dead.html">This</a> was tragic to hear. I remember hearing Tony Hsieh talk through his decision-making process around the sale of Zappos to Amazon. He was a visionary in the startup and early-stage venture community, and he illustrated the power of positivity and kindness.</li>
  <li>Love <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBa8GvuwUsU">this ad</a> with Leo Messi and its underlying message. Focus on what makes you unique, not your limitations. Messi grew up with a growth hormone deficiency, which made him smaller than other players around him - but he learned to play with his feet, leverage his lower center of gravity, and acquired the characteristics that make him the player he is today.</li>
  <li>There is something about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUeQNiXk0pQ">the process of making coffee</a> in the morning that I love. Mornings are definitely my favorite part of the day.</li>

  <li>It’s incredibly sad to hear tragic stories about people that pass, such as Tony Hsieh and Diego Maradona over this past weekend. I’m trying to reflect more on the characteristics that made people special and how we can incorporate them into our own lives. For Tony, he illustrated the power of kindness. Diego showed us passion and dedication to our craft.</li>
