*Any non-RT was written by me:*

Character, integrity, and decency are on the ballot. #VOTE

Democracy only works when its citizens are engaged. #Vote2020

@TIME RT: Here's why this year's flu vaccine will be so vital in the fight against COVID-19

@JoeBiden RT: Learning to live with it? Come on. People are dying with it, Mr. President.

@TomSteyer RT: Joe inherited the worse recession since 1929 and rebuilt our economy. Donald Trump inherited a booming economy and ran it into the gutter. That's the truth.

@CBSNews RT: Biden: "The fact of the matter is, there is institutional racism in America. And we have always said ‚Äî we've never lived up to it ‚Äî 'We hold these truth to be self-evident. All men and women are created equal.' Well guess what? We have never, ever lived up to it." #Debates2020

---

@BBCWorld RT:

‚ÄúThe fact of the matter is there is institutional racism in America‚Äù

Biden says ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never had to tell my daughter ‚Äòdon‚Äôt reach for the glove box‚Äô‚Äù

Trump responds ‚ÄúNobody has done more for the black community than Donald Trump‚Äù

#Debates2020 [bbc.in/3ohG1gu](http://bbc.in/3ohG1gu)

@BBCWorld RT:

"We're going to choose hope over fear"

Biden says "we can grow this economy and deal with systemic racism" in his final statement at the last presidential debate ahead of the US election

#Debates2020 [bbc.in/3ohG1gu](http://bbc.in/3ohG1gu)

---

@NYTimes RT: Kristen Welker, the second Black woman to moderate a presidential debate on her own, asked the candidates about the conversation that Black parents have with their children, telling them how to behave so police officers will not shoot them. #Debates2020

@AmitabhChandra2 RT: Boston and the Bay Area lead the world on productivity in the top science and medical journals-- Boston and New Haven punch well above their size

@MaggieRogers RT: Democracy only works if everyone participates.

@JoeBiden RT:

Enough of the lies. (re: Trump comments on the COVID-19 pandemic)

@JoeBiden RT: My Catholic faith drilled into me a core truth ‚Äî that every person on earth is equal in rights and dignity. As president, these are the principles that will shape all that I do, and my faith will continue to serve as my anchor, as it has my entire life.

@LRCSystems RT: As #AI application is expanding into more aspects of our lives, it's intriguing to ponder what's next. Uses related to healthcare, physics and consumer product formulation are only some of the innovative areas where science fiction has melded into reality.

@JoeBiden RT: President Obama and I left President Trump a playbook on how to deal with pandemics. He flat-out ignored it. And we're suffering every day because of it.

@BarronsOnline RT: Learn more about Powell's approach‚Äîand why he matters more for U.S. markets more than whoever will occupy the White House come 2021‚Äîin this week's Barron's cover story. [barrons.com/articles/why-j‚Ä¶](http://barrons.com/articles/why-j%E2%80%A6)

@Princetonian RT: As millions of Americans cast their ballots today, #tbt to when then-Sen. @JoeBiden donned a @Princeton cap as he questioned #SupremeCourt nominee Samuel Alito ‚Äô72 in 2006.

Biden can still win, but it's saddening to see that Trumpism (and all that Trump's [lack of] character signals) was not unequivocally extinguished tonight.

@TomSteyer RT:

This isn't over until all the votes are counted.

Take a deep breath. Let our election workers do their jobs. Let's count the votes and take back our country.

@SheelTyle RT: The fact that this isn't a landslide is an indictment on our values as a nation.

@DrBiden RT: Keep the faith.

@GovRaimondo RT: Yesterday, voters came together to send a message that the State of Rhode Island stands for equality & inclusion. This is an important step in our ongoing fight to address the systemic racism that‚Äôs plagued our state & our nation for centuries. #YesOn1RI

@JoeBiden RT: To make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as enemies. We are not enemies.

@JoeBiden RT: I am confident we will emerge victorious, but this will not be my victory or our victory alone. It will be a victory for the American people, for our democracy, for America.

@JoeBiden RT: Power can't be taken or asserted, it flows from the people, and it's their will that determines who will be the President of the United States.

How the candidates are behaving at this moment already signals who should be President - Biden is already trying to unite the country, heal us, and weave together the frayed fabric of our society. Trump is trying to tear us apart.

@JoeBiden RT:

I‚Äôm confident that we will emerge victorious.

But this will not be my victory alone.

It will be a victory for the American people.

@JoeBiden RT: Today, the Trump Administration officially left the Paris Climate Agreement. And in exactly 77 days, a Biden Administration will rejoin it.

@Ben_Golub RT:

To all the many who phone- and text-banked tirelessly, voted, and helped in other ways, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

No matter what happens, the outcomes seem to be vindicating the importance of every last vote.

---

One of the most uplifting aspects of Presidential elections is how we come together after the decision has been made and put the divisive campaign rhetoric behind us. Let's come together and push forward as one nation, regardless of the outcome.

@RooseveltTed RT: Does anyone in the Trump camp know that the only way he can win the election is if they keep counting votes?

---

Votes are not "coming in" after Election Day - they are being COUNTED after Election Day. The votes have been cast appropriately. Trump is deliberating using vague language to convey a false claim.

You can tell by Trump's tone of voice how much he truly believes in his assertions. It signals everything we need to know. If he genuinely believed in his claims of a corrupt election, he would be displaying the zealous rhetoric we know him for.

@PaulKrugman RT: Not watching Trump, but getting feedback ‚Äî and terrified by the thought that this guy will still be Commander-in-Chief for more than 2 months

@Stengel RT: Having the president of the United States read a long list of local election grievances without evidence doesn‚Äôt seem like a very good election strategy.

@PeterBakerNYT RT: Trump says he is being cheated because Biden is picking up votes in some states as the counting proceeds while boasting that he is picking up votes in Arizona as the counting proceeds.

@NickKristof RT: Pres Trump just gave a speech -- not a press conference, as he had billed it -- full of lies about the election. It's bad enough when Russian hackers try to sow doubt about US democracy, and far sadder when the same job is performed by the president speaking from the White House.

@RobMay RT: Working on my Edge AI thesis for 2021. Any companies you are really excited about in that space?

@RobMayRT: This is called "class" and Trump does not have it. Luckily, some Republicans still do.

@VermontGMG RT: Every GOP politician has a choice to make tonight: Do you stand for American democracy or do you stand with Donald Trump? There is no middle ground; courage is necessary.

@JoeBiden RT:

No one is going to take our democracy away from us. Not now, not ever.

America has come too far, fought too many battles, and endured too much to let that happen.

---

@RyanDEnos RT: Every democracy that has slipped a way has faced this exact moment. What is it going to be America? Do not let him take our country from us.

@RyanDEnos RT: That was quite possibly the most dangerous and un-american speech in presidential history.

@Princetonian RT:

Below, you‚Äôll discover how Alito and other alumni, from @MichelleObama ‚Äô85 to @tedcruz ‚Äô92, have shaped our world in 2020.

[projects.dailyprincetonian.com/most-influenti‚Ä¶](http://projects.dailyprincetonian.com/most-influenti%E2%80%A6)

@AshaRangappa_ RT: Today my positive thought that gives me faith in democracy is that the media has handled the delay in election results very well. In particular, they did a good job of setting expectations in advance that this wouldn't be a "night of" affair, and it is paying off now

---

It's crazy how close Georgia is right now

Yes, Trump may have achieved the greatest rate of economic growth in history over the past few months, but that's relative to a hugely distressed benchmark and sunken baseline - the statistic is far from a victory, and using it as a metric for policymaking success is misguided.

The measured GDP growth rate being the fastest rate ever does not indicate success in this context - in fact, it points to an inadequate pandemic response in the preceding quarter.

---

@Business RT:

Georgia is close. Really close.

Trump now leads Biden by just 2,497 votes according to the AP #Election2020

That‚Äôs a difference of less than 0.05% [trib.al/jxPicDX](http://trib.al/jxPicDX)

@JohnKingCNN RT: Oh my ........

Biden now leading in Georgia although would expect a recount if lead isn‚Äôt >0.5% by the end of the tally

@PaulKrugman RT: If you had somehow been blissfully unaware of Trump's existence until two days ago, his behavior since then would have been enough to prove him morally and intellectually unfit for any position of responsibility.

---

Again, votes are being counted during this period and were ‚Äúaccepted‚Äù by Election Day; votes being counted post-Election Day does not mean they were ‚Äúaccepted‚Äù or cast post-Election Day. Trump lacking specificity again to assert something false.

Compulsive lying is an ingrained personality trait of Trump - we‚Äôve seen it for years - why hasn‚Äôt it been thoroughly repudiated by voters? It‚Äôs already done damage to the US‚Äô reputation on the world stage. Biden must win.

Hoping today is the day. Come on PA.

Rhyme unintended. :)

@JohnKingCNN RT: GA goes blue as sun rises on what could be a decisive day. Next PA ballot count update expected soon and narrow #Trump lead in deep peril.

@BrianKlass RT: The calls are beginning.

@KaushikcBasu RT: The whole world needed a reset. This is the start.

@Dany_Bahar RT: La diferencia es que Biden no tiene una historia de mentiroso patol√≥gico y de plantar teor√≠as de conspiraci√≥n desde el podio. El presidente Trump si. Y los medios tienen el deber de no transmitir mentiras, vengan de donde vengan, inclusive un presidente.

@Stengel RT: To media folks, let's be careful about using temporal verbs like votes are "surging," "gaining," "increasing." They're not. The votes were duly cast, and officials are counting more of them‚Äîbut no votes themselves are increasing. That kind of language fuels conspiracy theories.

@AshaRangappa_ RT: Any future tweets, speeches, etc. by Trump need to be accompanied by a sad tuba

@PaulG RT: Prediction: We will owe Ivanka Trump a favor, because she's the one who will tell him "It's over," thus averting all sorts of messiness.

@Alyssa_Milano RT: Madam Vice President. #HERstory

@RooseveltTed RT: This is one slooooow count before the bell rings.

@NBT RT: Vibes.

@JimmyFallon RT: I‚Äôm getting carpal tunnel from hitting refresh.

@EzraKlein RT: We're about to get a very vivid lesson in why having a long lame-duck period in politics, where a defeated president still wields full presidential power, is dangerous.

@Stengel RT: Our institutions are resilient and will usher in a peaceful transition of power. The Constitution works.

@Ben_Golub RT: Aviation nerd dimension of this - airspace restricted now above Biden's house, and a bigger bubble around Wilmington set up starting later today.

@ArneDuncan RT:

As we move towards the conclusion of this election, the biggest question I am struggling with is how do we try to knit our country back together?
How do we reduce the level of polarization and divisiveness?

Would love to hear your thoughts, suggestions and ideas!

@ArneDuncan RT:

Feels like this is from a different century and a different country.
Actually, it‚Äôs just from someone with a different character.

Congratulations to @SenJackReed on his re-election as senator - excited for him and @SenWhitehouse as they continue to represent RI in the U.S. Senate

@AngelaDuckW RT:

Spending 10 minutes a week writing a #gratitude letter led to increased motivation and life satisfaction for high school students.

Fascinating work from @slyubomirsky and colleagues just published in @APA's Emotion.
[sonjalyubomirsky.com/files/2020/06/‚Ä¶](http://sonjalyubomirsky.com/files/2020/06/%E2%80%A6)

Thank you @StephenAtHome.
A must-watch

@JoyceCarolOates RT: #Resistance enters a new phase--a restoration of justice.

@Dany_Bahar RT: most of my WhatsApp conversations in the past few days abruptly end after I say "please share the evidence of what you just said"...

@AnaFabrega11 RT:

Kids who think from first principles understand that if most of the systems framing our lives are human constructed, they can also be reconstructed.

What's more powerful than that?

@AshaRangappa_ RT: Can we just stipulate that if Biden wins, and even if Trump loses all his "claims" in court, he is going to say the election was stolen, and is going to repeat that story until the end of time? It's not newsworthy. It's the only thing he knows how to do. JUST IGNORE

@JAltma RT: I look forward to returning to our regularly scheduled programming of SPACs, the future of remote, and how many hours per weeks you should work.

@Stengel RT: We've had presidents who were competent but corrupt (Nixon) and presidents who were incompetent but not corrupt (Hoover), but we've never had a president who was utterly incompetent and utterly corrupt.

I‚Äôve always had immense respect for John McCain - throughout his entire career he displayed courage, honor, and a fortitude in his character that is so clearly absent in our incumbent president. He never wavered from his principles. May he rest in peace.

@ArneDuncan RT:

Trump lost this election not on policies, but on character.
I pray that this is a lesson for every aspiring politician, forever.

@JakeSherman RT: BIDEN has a ‚Äúbigger mandate than John F. Kennedy,‚Äù @SpeakerPelosi said

@JoyceCarolOates RT: sobering to think that if T***p had displayed the most minimal leadership, even a pretense of "sympathy," for those stricken w/ the virus, he might have won the election despite his dismal record.

@LRCSystems RT: Cheers to @ShiniSomara for her storybook series written to encourage young readers to pursue #STEM studies! More inquisitive minds learning about these fields will improve our ability to propel innovations that change the world.

@AdamMGrant RT:

Showing red vs. blue maps leads people to see America as more divided‚Äîand judge people more by their state's stereotypes.

Data: purple maps of state proportions are more accurate, and reduce perceived polarization and stereotypes.

@GuyGrossman RT: POTUS is lying. Observers were allowed into polling stations in PHL. I know this, because I was one of them.

@NYTDavidBrooks RT: I‚Äôm already enjoying using the past tense when I write about Donald Trump.

@AdrienneLaF RT: A quote for the ages: ‚ÄúWhat I am enjoying is that the most famously anti-science, anti-factual president of my lifetime is now being slowly taught mathematics, and the inescapable consequences of mathematics." @IsaacDovere's latest, just published

@JoeBiden RT:

What is becoming clearer each hour is that record numbers of Americans ‚Äî from all races, faiths, regions ‚Äî chose change over more of the same.

They have given us a mandate for action on COVID and the economy and climate change and systemic racism.

---

Now THAT is how the U.S. President should speak. Biden focused on the right themes in his speech - unity, healing, resolve.

The U.S. has always been a beacon of hope and democracy to the world, and the presidency is the core way we display these ideals. We‚Äôve missed this the past four years.

Whenever Biden ends his speeches with ‚Äúand may God protect our troops‚Äù - it just resonates so much. ü•∫üò≠üëèüôè

@MichaelPryor RT: May God bless you and may God protect our troops! I‚Äôm not even religious but when he says it, it feels better than Headspace.

@Jeannieologist RT: I like how he ends all his speeches with God protect our troops. He must think of his son Beau when he says it...its such a contrast to the lack of sacrifice on the side of the Trump family, born into pure aristocracy and never fighting for America.

@EFeng RT: Something I haven't heard in a long time and sorely missed: the president elect of the United States of America actually acting and sounding presidential.

@JoyceCarolOates RT: Founding Fathers had a weird idea when they designated something called "media" to "call" the winners of presidential elections.

@NewYorker RT: James Baker‚Äôs struggle in the last five years is a parable for the Republican establishment that he once embodied, a political leadership that ultimately chose to reconcile itself to Donald Trump.

@NBCNews RT:

Supreme Court Justice Alito orders Pennsylvania election officials to comply with directive issued by secretary of state to keep mail ballots separate that arrived after election day but before Friday at 5pm

He did not order the state to stop counting

Today we celebrate:
Character
Science
Kindness
Hope
Unity
Decency
Safety
Justice
Democracy
Truth
üá∫üá∏

This was a win for it all. A lot more work to be done.

@ArneDuncan RT: America just won

@NewYorker RT: American democracy has survived Donald J. Trump.

@SteveMartinToGo RT: Grammar is back!

@Stengel RT: Words we haven't heard for the last four years: unity, joy, vision, sharing, heart.

Biden: ‚ÄúTonight, the whole world is watching America. And I believe at our best, America is a beacon for the globe. We will lead not by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.‚Äù

@JFlier RT: Welcome back Presidential decency. It has been a long, long time.

Biden: 'I'll have the honor of serving with a fantastic Vice President...Kamala Harris, who makes history as the first woman,..the first daughter of immigrants ever elected in this country. Don't tell me it's not possible in the United States.‚Äù

This gave me chills ‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏

This resonates so much right now - Whitney Houston singing the national anthem in 1991 ‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏ [https://youtu.be/N_lCmBvYMRs](https://youtu.be/N_lCmBvYMRs)

I feel like this needs to be recirculated.

@PeteButtigieg RT: Imagine how it will feel the first time the sun comes up and Donald Trump is no longer the president of the United States.

@AmySundae RT:

‚ÄúDream with ambition, lead with conviction, and see yourselves in a way that others may not, simply because they‚Äôve never seen it before‚Äù

@Business RT: President-elect Joe Biden‚Äôs victory signals a turning point in the U.S. response to the coronavirus pandemic

@ConanOBrien RT: So NOW Trump wants to quarantine in the White House.

@Ashokaraj_ RT: Fortunately, the Biden/Harris COVID plan is so incredibly refreshing [buildbackbetter.com/priorities/cov‚Ä¶](http://buildbackbetter.com/priorities/cov%E2%80%A6)

This. [https://youtu.be/JIjenjANqAk](https://youtu.be/JIjenjANqAk)

@WSJ RT: Former President George W. Bush said Sunday he had spoken to President-elect Joe Biden. ‚ÄúI offered him the same thing I offered Presidents Trump and Obama: my prayers for his success, and my pledge to help in any way I can."

@ChrisLu44 RT: Morning in America

@KamalaHarris RT: .@JoeBiden is a healer, a uniter, a tested, and steady hand. A person whose own experience of loss gives him a sense of purpose that will help us, as a nation, reclaim our own sense of purpose.

@Transition46 RT: The President-elect spoke with former President Bush this morning.

@Transition46 RT:

The task ahead of the Biden-Harris administration is unlike any other in our history.

In preparation, our transition will be led by experts, by science, and with character‚Äîensuring that we will be ready to lead on Day One.

@ConanOBrien RT:

‚ÄúSorry about the other stuff. Did you get the election I sent you? Are we good now?‚Äù
-2020

@E_Hernandez8 RT: Just look at this plan. Pinch me. (1/7)

@JoeBiden RT: Biden will enter the White House with something no president has had before: robust popular support for climate action

Appreciation post for @LesterHoltNBC #throwback

@NBCNightlyNews RT:

WATCH: @LesterHoltNBC's closing thoughts from tonight's broadcast ahead of Election Day:

We have to let democracy work, "if not for ourselves, then for our children, who you know are watching us."

@NYTimes RT: President-elect Joe Biden pleaded for Americans to set aside the bitterness of the election and wear masks, as the country's virus cases now average 111,000 per day.

@RichardHaass RT: If @realDonaldTrump & those around him were fighting a lethal virus with half the intensity they are fighting a legitimate election both the health of American citizens and the health of our democracy would be much improved.

@LRCSystems RT: Today we celebrate World Science Day for Peace & Development. We strongly support the focus of this day that highlights the critical role science plays in addressing global challenges. #ScienceDay [en.unesco.org/commemorations‚Ä¶](http://en.unesco.org/commemorations%E2%80%A6)

@JoeBiden RT:

Today, we honor the service of those who have worn the uniform of the Armed Forces of the United States.

To our proud veterans‚ÄîI will be a commander in chief who respects your sacrifice, understands your service, and will never betray the values you fought so bravely to defend.

@TomSteyer RT:

Around 73-87% of Black, Asian and Latino voters between age 18 and 29 voted for @joebiden and @kamalaharris. Without them, the election would have had an entirely different outcome.

Proud of the work @NextGenAmerica did to help get out the #youthvote.

Yes, Trump may have accrued the largest number of non-white votes for a Republican candidate in a long time, but that doesn't mean anything relative to population growth and economic changes over time. Furthermore, there was record-breaking voter turnout this election.

This propelled the number further up and so Trump can't claim that the uptick is any way meaningful or resultant of his policies. Claims about raw actuals without any context is not useful given the temporal dynamics.

@NickKristof RT: Trump is denying reality and impeding a lawful transition in ways that diminish the United States before the world, that make our country less governable and that risk inciting violence. This is presidential vandalism.

The Junior Science and Humanities Symposia (JSHS) Program is a STEM competition sponsored by the @USArmy, @USNavy, and @USAirForce. During the National Symposium, we visited various @DeptofDefense research centers and laboratories, including...

...the DoD's Advanced Technology Development research area. Throughout the weekend, the symposium augmented my immense appreciation for our military, the people that comprise it, and the important role that technology plays in our national security. #VeteransDay üá∫üá∏

(Also pictured: Jeffrey Singleton, Director of Technology, U.S. Army)

@LRCSystems RT: Congrats to #HIV Prevention Trials Network on its groundbreaking advancement in prevention for women. Brilliant six-shot protocol will transform efficacy rates over daily pill routine saving lives worldwide.

@JasonFurman RT: I suboptimally undertweet about the obvious but extremely important. Like (not exhaustively or equivalently) we should close indoor dining/bars/etc ASAP, Judy Shelton is the worst Fed pick in my lifetime, and Trump admin is hurting all of us by blocking the transition process.

@KamalaHarris RT:

Hope.
Unity.
Decency.
Truth.

These are the ideals that will guide a @JoeBiden-Harris administration.

---

Omitted variable bias from population growth and unprecedented voter turnout.

Better to gauge by proportion of votes rather than the raw actuals.

Re: @realDonaldTrump RT: 71,000,000 Legal Votes. The most EVER for a sitting President!

@JAltma RT: Spend your morning work hours on thinking and writing, not meetings and email.

@TheEconomist RT: Joe Biden is not a miracle cure for what ails America. But he would restore steadiness and civility to the White House‚Äîand begin the long, difficult task of putting a fractured country back together again

One of the things I love about Biden winning is the corroboration of the notion that small states like Delaware (and Rhode Island) can be in the national conversation too. Go small states! üòÅ

Even though it wasn‚Äôt an LBJ v Goldwater-esque landslide, it still feels like an immense victory to defeat an incumbent president.

@Guardian RT: Dr Anthony Fauci says US in 'very difficult situation' as Covid infections continue to grow ‚Äì video

@SCOTUSReporter RT: Justice Alito says pandemic has resulted in ‚Äòunimaginable‚Äô restrictions on individual liberty

@PeterBakerNYT RT: Not exactly "rounding the corner": New coronavirus cases in the U.S. topped 160,000 today, five times the peak back in April when it was thought to be at its worst. And 1,431 people died of covid in the U.S. yesterday alone, not quite "almost nothing."

@CDCGov RT: New @CDCMMWR suggests that the #COVID19 pandemic may be negatively impacting children‚Äôs mental health. The proportion of emergency room visits for mental health concerns in children & adolescents increased substantially this past Mar.-Oct. Read the report: [bit.ly/6945a3](http://bit.ly/6945a3)

@NYTimes RT: The U.S. surpassed 10 million coronavirus cases on Sunday, and experts say the virus is spreading out of control. With winter ahead, the next 73 days before Inauguration Day could be critical for controlling the pandemic.

@NewYorker RT: Unless decisive action is taken, the American COVID-19 death toll could reach 400,000 by January.

@KyleGriffin1 RT:

NBC News confirms: The United States has reported 159,501 new cases of COVID-19 today.

This is the 9th day in a row with more than 100,000 coronavirus cases reported in the U.S. @MSNBC

@NBCNews RT: Dr. Fauci says the country needs to make an "abrupt change" in its public health practices and behaviors as the holiday season nears.

If you‚Äôre interested in contributing to tech, ventures, and startups specifically aimed at combating the COVID-19 pandemic and current public health crisis - send me a note at daniel.ling@lrc.systems

Working on a tech-enabled platform geared towards accelerating the development of novel vaccines such as the COVID-19 vaccine

@Business RT: Almost no part of the U.S. is being spared in the surge in Covid-19 cases, according to the CDC

America was founded on ideals and principles, on starting ‚Äúanew‚Äù and building a free country from the ground up, a premise that the world looks to as a beacon of hope for democracy and an experiment in liberty that flourished. May we lead by the example we were born with.

The media can be too much sometimes, but I think there‚Äôs a lot of good in the media landscape too. I think of Rachel Maddow‚Äôs candor and honesty with which she conducts her reporting and interviews.

The sheer multitude of people/entities - the media, politicians, the public - condemning Trump‚Äôs actions has to be indicative of something. The fact that the world is so comprehensively disapproving, and the dislike is coming from so many people - it has to have some truth to it.

I agree that the media can be ruthless and overextend at times, but the volume and comprehensiveness of negative opinion has to have some shred of validity. The converse can also be said.

At some point, Trump has to turn inwardly and acknowledge that maybe he‚Äôs done something wrong - when there are this many people showing disapproval of you.

How could there be so many people accusing him of wrongdoing, without at least an ounce of truth there?

Ideas should be judged based on their merits, not on the color of the person‚Äôs party, or skin for that matter, or any surface-level characteristic.

I think the Electoral College came through this time. While there are a lot of people that disapprove of the way we choose presidents via EVs, I still think it‚Äôs a reliable way of choosing presidents and avoids a lot of the potential perils that come with relying on a popular vote - e.g. avoids issues around mob mentality, the spreading of disinformation, conspiracy theories, etc.

Many who take issue with the Electoral College point to Bush v Gore - although I think Gore would have been a great president, I liked Bush a lot. He had many of the qualities of decency, honor, and the raw bedrock of character that Biden has - a principled-ness that‚Äôs so vital for the U.S. presidency - a person that will steer the nation through tumultuous waters with a steady hand. Character is one of, if not the, most important quality of the president, in my mind.
