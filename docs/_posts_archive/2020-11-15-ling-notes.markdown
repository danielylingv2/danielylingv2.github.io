*Every Sunday, I write a quick newsletter to share some thoughts, things I've learned, and a few of my favorite things from the week. Enjoy!*

Hey friends,

I think creativity is such an interesting category of productivity. We can be creative in a wide variety of disciplines - music composition, writing, scientific research, company-building, anything. And I think tenets of creativity in one discipline can help inform work in another area. This "cross-pollination" can be useful I think.

I'll be putting my writing on Substack in addition to my personal website, so that people can sign up and get it sent directly to their inboxes. Hope this is helpful.

Have a great week!\
Daniel

### Things that resonated with me this week

1. [This](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1327765347936522240?s=20) was a great piece that references Ed Sheeran's songwriting approach, describing a "creativity faucet." It's about volume and continuing to create - whether it's music composition, writing, or even scientific research, and you discover along the way.
2. [A great primer](https://www.nicknish.co/blog/what-makes-notion-great) on Notion and all of its benefits.
3. I love [Messi's focus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jViVVq6NI4M) in the pre-game warmup here.

### Things I'm trying out

- Trying to write more, as usual. I think the "creativity faucet" mental model applies here as well.

### Stuff that's on my mind

- I think Biden's approach to addressing the pandemic reflects the much-needed leadership we need in Washington.
