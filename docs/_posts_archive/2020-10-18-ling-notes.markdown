*Every Sunday, I write a quick newsletter to share some thoughts, things I've learned, and a few of my favorite things from the week. Enjoy!*

Hey friends,

I've been thinking about how we can bifurcate two different "types" of thinking and operating - the "child" and the "adult". I think there are important elements of the "child" that are incredibly useful and essential to retain, such as the child's uninhibited approach to creativity. There are not so good qualities of the child, such as recklessness. The same can be said of the "adult" - I think the maturity and strength of resolve seen in adults are important qualities to have, while other characteristics such as the tendency to overthink are not so good.

This leads me to think that we ought to select and choose the elements of each type that are good for us, and discard the elements that are not good - adopting the full set of characteristics of either one can be detrimental. Hope this is a helpful or at least interesting mental model. I'll talk more about this in a future newsletter.

Have a great week!\
Daniel

### Things that resonated with me this week

1. [This was a great podcast episode with Hillary Clinton and Conan O'Brien](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hillary-clinton-returns/id1438054347?i=1000494675684) where they discuss ethical behavior, character, morality, and the issues surrounding systemic racism, institutional racism, and racial injustice.
2. I enjoyed reading [this study](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life/) that showed that "our relationships and how happy we are in our relationships have a powerful influence on our health."
3. [This](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/koda-movable-loft-tiny-home-available-us-customers-summer-2020-5-1029197049#the-windows-in-the-kitchen-as-well-as-the-upstairs-bedroom-can-open-to-let-in-fresh-air-14) looks like an interesting product.

### Things I'm trying out

- I like sipping on chamomile every night while I fill out my daily entry in Notion. Would highly recommend - both the chamomile tea at night, and the journaling at the end of your day.

### Stuff that's on my mind

- I've come to appreciate how prolific some people in the music industry are - such as Justin Bieber. No matter your opinions on his music, you have to appreciate how prolific and productive he is.

### Quote of the week
