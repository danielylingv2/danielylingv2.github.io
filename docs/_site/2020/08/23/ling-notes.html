    <p><em>This is my weekly newsletter where I write about health, productivity, and mindset. I’ll be sharing it here every Sunday.</em></p>

<p>Hey friends,</p>

<p>I went on a morning walk yesterday as the sun was going up, and it was glorious. It was my first morning walk in a while.</p>

<p>It was quiet and serene. A multitude of birds were out and about in my neighborhood. I could still hear the quiet but ever present hum of the remaining nighttime grasshoppers chirping. And of course, the steady patter of my footsteps underneath.</p>

<p>I’ve never been so grateful to be in a serene environment. I’ve worked in two of the major U.S. urban centers since graduating from college, and have enjoyed every minute of it. But I feel we can often take for granted the serene moments and tranquil settings that we may find ourselves in. We often yearn for commotion, volatility. But it’s important to cherish our serene surroundings when we do have it. While many of us are working remotely during this time of COVID-19, may we seek out the moments of solitude and calmness when we can. It’s good to disconnect for a bit.</p>

<p>Have a great week!<br />
Daniel</p>

<h3 id="things-that-resonated-with-me-this-week">Things that resonated with me this week</h3>

<ol>
  <li>I was moved by Lauv’s performance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjKruLdyXq0&amp;list=RDVQdglo6mBcU&amp;index=22">here</a>. He’s absorbed in his performance, as if he’s alone in the auditorium and it’s just him and the piano. For some reason, it’s always inspiring to see someone fully immersed in his or her craft.</li>
  <li>Tyler Adam’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk4wycbtfOw">collectedness</a> at his post-match interview, after having scored a game-winning goal to send his team to the Champions League semifinal, was inspiring (perhaps more than so than the goal itself). His maturity at such a young age is something I try to strive for myself, even though I’m a few years older. We are never too young to display maturity and composure, even when things can get a little crazy.</li>
  <li>I recently read the <a href="http://www.raindance.co.uk/site/scripts/Inception.pdf">script</a> for Inception without any audio or visuals, and it was inspiring to see how much of the initial writing dictated the filming and eventual final reel. Some of the written scenes described the final rendered output to the tee. Some did not, but it was remarkable to see how some scenes went straight from Christopher Nolan envisioning, to making it on the final screen. I think this is one of the obvious benefits of “vertically integrating” the directing and screenwriting process.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="things-im-trying-out">Things I’m trying out</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Checking email once per day. I think setting a consistent time stabilizes the mind, and having no structure around this can quickly get out of hand. It also teaches you to be succinct and efficient with your writing to maximize your productivity when you are in your inbox.</li>
  <li>I recently realized that the word breakfast may have come from the notion of “breaking the fast”, after essentially fasting overnight. The metabolism halts during this period, and, with the first meal of the day, we’re breaking this fast and jumpstarting our energy production processes. With this in mind, I’m aiming to eat breakfast within an hour of waking up.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="stuff-thats-on-my-mind">Stuff that’s on my mind</h3>

<ul>
  <li>It’s important to disengage and write sometimes. And to write from a place of intentionality. We can get lost in the natural entropy of life, and it’s essential to sit back and write sometimes. With your own thoughts undisturbed. Not only is it cathartic, but it’s also a process of self-discovery; you discover new things and new ideas along the way, just from the process of putting pen to paper. I’m making this a habit of at least once a week of long-form writing, and journaling each day.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="quote-of-the-week">Quote of the week</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.” - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</p>
