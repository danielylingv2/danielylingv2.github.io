    <p><em>Every Sunday, I write a quick newsletter to share some thoughts, things I’ve learned, and a few of my favorite things from the week. Enjoy!</em></p>

<p>Hey friends,</p>

<p>Hope all is well with you all. I’ve been thinking a lot about certain role models recently, and how there are a lot of valuable principles that can be adopted from leaders in different industries and fields, and that you can learn things from people in seemingly disparate fields. Tom Brady is one person who I learn a lot from, in terms of both his professional mindsets and personal mental frameworks. He talks often about the importance of controlling what you can control, and not worrying about things that are out of your control.</p>

<p>That’s what enables him to focus at each training session, day in day out. Control the things you can control, like the drills that you’re doing, the small exercises to put yourself in the best position possible. And then don’t worry about anything else that you simply have no control over, such as the result of the game, or if your receiver is going to keep his footing and get the touchdown. Put your best foot forward and then don’t worry about the rest. Good habits compound over time. It goes back to a quote from Michelle Obama, when she said, “Just roll up your sleeves, do the work, put your best self out there, and don’t worry about the rest.”</p>

<p>The concept of not worrying about things out of your control seems simple in theory, but can be difficult in practice. It’s a mindset that can be trained, and I think it’s vital for us to focus on the things we can control and not stress about the things we simply have no control over. And that’s a liberating mindset to have once adopted. And again, it’s not so simple in practice. But, as they say, practice makes perfect. Keep going, and take a few moments in your day to stop, recognize this, and carry onward. Put your best foot forward, roll up the sleeves and do the work, and don’t worry about the rest. This also makes me think of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/darcy-carden/id1438054347?i=1000470613265">this podcast episode</a> with Conan O’Brien and D’arcy Carden, where they talk about how, when you just do the work, and not ask for attention, people will seek you out. Don’t be the person that tries to call attention to himself/herself or tries to draw plaudits for the sake of plaudits. This also goes back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/professor-j-michael-kosterlitz-topological-phase-transitions/id1530452927?i=1000492663352">my podcast discussion</a> with Prof. Mike Kosterlitz, where he talks about working on things for the sake of the work itself, and working on a particular problem for the sake of the problem itself - not for some extrinsic motivation like a Nobel Prize. And that’s when your best prize-winning work usually comes anyways. Do things for the sake of the work itself and the underlying mission of what you’re working on/for.</p>

<p>This is a theme with Conan (another person I’ve learned a lot from) - he says on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcF1OoWqXBc">his final episode of the Tonight Show</a>, “I hate cynicism, for the record it’s my least favorite quality. Work hard, be kind, and amazing things happen.” I think this is very true and a life philosophy I abide by every single day. Just stick to your principles, work hard and be kind, and amazing things happen. Take care out there, and be your best self!</p>

<p>Have a great week!<br />
Daniel</p>

<h3 id="things-that-resonated-with-me-this-week">Things that resonated with me this week</h3>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/10/08/major-gift-mellody-hobson-91-names-new-residential-college">This</a> was exciting to see (Mellody Hobson creating a new residential college at Princeton). Although it’ll sad to see my old residential college (Wilson College, now called First College) replaced, it’ll be great to see Hobson College established, as well as all that it symbolizes. I, along with many others, do not agree with Woodrow Wilson’s racist views, and removing his name from the college is an apt move. I contend that Wilson was a great president for other reasons, but his racist perspective was unacceptable, and any representation of this view has no place on campus or in any area of our society. Systemic racism pervades the world we live in and can often persist, sometimes subconsciously and unknowingly, and it’s absolutely imperative to dispel any conceptions or notions of racism, thoroughly and comprehensively, in our society. Overall, it’s great news that the University is removing his name, which serves as a much-needed symbol of the stand against racism. I’ve often kept quiet about societal issues like this, but I feel as though it’s gotten to a point in our current landscape, especially with recent events such as those that involved George Floyd, Christian Cooper, and the outpouring of reactions and reverberation that followed, where it’s no longer tolerable to keep quiet. It’s time to stand up, and to do everything we can in the name of justice.</li>
  <li>I recently happened upon and rewatched Justin Bieber’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOI4OF7iIr4"><em>Somebody to Love</em> music video</a>, and it brought back a lot of nice memories from high school 10 years ago. I hope it’s an enjoyable blast from the past for you too.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww9HDYmxb7E&amp;feature=emb_title">This was a great talk</a> from Nobel laureate Jean Tirole, who came to the Bendheim Center for Finance to discuss public and private spheres, and the authentic self. Hope you enjoy.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="things-im-trying-out">Things I’m trying out</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I’m trying out a new podcast idea with my brother where we catch up on a weekly basis and talk about things that have resonated with us and things we’re noticing in our world. Topics range from social concepts and mental models, to health and happiness. Episodes to be released starting in Q1 of next year.</li>
  <li>I recently purchased a standing desk, which I can’t recommend enough for those that spend a large portion of their days working at their desks. It’s a great investment especially for productivity nerds like myself.</li>
  <li>Writing more.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="stuff-thats-on-my-mind">Stuff that’s on my mind</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The concept of the attention economy is real, as mentioned on my podcast episode with Russell Bogue (soon to be released), and I think it’s important to treat our attention (especially on a day to day horizon) as a scarce resource and protect it. This means blocking out distractions and designing your work environment in an optimal way that maximizes focus.</li>
</ul>
