*Every Sunday, I write a quick newsletter to share some thoughts, things I've learned, and a few of my favorite things from the week. Enjoy!*

Hey friends,

It feels so good to hear a speech from a (soon-to-be) U.S. President that actually sounds presidential. We've missed this the past four years. Finally, decency, character, integrity, and honor is coming back to the White House.

Have a great week!\
Daniel

### Things that resonated with me this week

1. Excited to see [this name change](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/01/politics/rhode-island-providence-plantations-ballot-question/index.html).
2. This was a [great op-ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/opinion/trump-election-lies.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage) in the New York Times.
3. I loved VP-elect Kamala Harris' [victory speech](https://www.nytimes.com/article/Kamala-Harris-speech-transcript.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage). She had a great quote: “Dream with ambition, lead with conviction, and see yourselves in a way that others may not, simply because they’ve never seen it before.”

### Things I'm trying out

- I'm meditating first thing in the morning after waking up, as well as right before bed before sleeping. I've found it to be a nice way of both starting and capping off the day.

### Stuff that's on my mind

- I think a lot of people tend to not approve or believe in something, simply because they haven't seen it before. Precedent is hard to ignore. But it's important to have a healthy belief in things that might be perceived as impossible. You be the one to break barriers. It goes back to this mental framework that I think is life-changing - having a "Why Not You" mindset, versus a "Who Are You" mindset.

### Quote of the week

> "I'll have the honor of serving with a fantastic Vice President...Kamala Harris, who makes history as the first woman,..the first daughter of immigrants ever elected in this country. Don't tell me it's not possible in the United States.” - Joe Biden
