*Every Sunday, I write a quick newsletter to share some thoughts, things I've learned, and a few of my favorite things from the week. Enjoy!*

Hey friends,

Hope everything had a great week. One health tidbit that I've been really committing to is diversifying my diet. I think eating the same thing can be a bit detrimental, and a commitment to eating a lot of different things, is not only enjoyable, but also conducive to giving your body a wide variety of nutrients. Hope you are all staying healthy out there.

Have a great week!\
Daniel

### Things that resonated with me this week

1. [This](https://twitter.com/kyletibbitts/status/1313283530340724736?s=12) was a great tweet about accruing comprehensive experiences in a variety of disciplines, that enables you to have a truly unique perspective.
2. I've been looking for a way to describe this genre of music that encompasses Lifehouse, Avril Lavigne, and so forth, and I think I've finally found [it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-grunge).
3. This was a [great article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/arts/music/mostly-mozart-festival-lincoln-center.html) on an orchestral performance that I really liked.

### Things I'm trying out

- I'm trying to be more introspective - and writing, such as this newsletter and in general, really enables you to do that

### Stuff that's on my mind

- Listening to past decades of music can be a source of inspiration when it comes to music composition. From Tears for Fears, to the Backstreet Boys, elements of past music can help inform creating truly unique music in the present day.

### Quote of the week
