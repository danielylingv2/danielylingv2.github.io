*Every Sunday, I write a quick newsletter to share some thoughts, things I've learned, and a few of my favorite things from the week. Enjoy!*

Hey friends,

Again, wanted to dedicate this one to the upcoming election. I have never seen an election as important as this one, so everyone please vote!

Have a great week!\
Daniel

### Things that resonated with me this week

1. [The lyrics](https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/maggierogers/alaska.html) of Maggie Rogers' Alaska is thoroughly cathartic.
2. Would be excited to [see Joe Biden picking Gina Raimondo](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/08/25/metro/if-biden-wins-whats-next-governor-raimondo/) in his administration.
3. [This](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/battleground-states.html) is a useful article.

### Things I'm trying out

- I'm trying to do both a "morning section" and "before bed" section of my daily entry in Notion. It's a nice way to start the day and end the day.

### Stuff that's on my mind

- This election is incredibly important. Please, everyone get out there and #vote.

### Quote of the week

> “I’ve always liked economics because it’s part science and part practical. It keeps you involved in the world around you. It’s hard to be an economist without being interested in the world around you." - Michael Spence
