Diego Maradona taught us that you don’t have to be the biggest, or the fastest (or whatever physical attribute or inherited circumstance of life), to be the best. Find what makes you unique (for him it was agility and learning to play with the ball at his feet), optimize on that, and don’t worry about the rest. Have the mindset of striving to be the best version of yourself, and suddenly there is no limit to what’s possible. Rest in peace, Diego.

It also goes back to [this quote](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bj5pbiXDRMw/) from Kaka.
