Inspired by [Paul Graham's quotes page](http://www.paulgraham.com/quo.html), these are some quotes about science, technology, venture capital, life, productivity, and health that I've resonated with - hope you take something from them too.

<br>

> "The imagination of nature is far, far greater than the imagination of man."  <br />
> &mdash; Richard Feynman

> “I’ve always liked economics because it’s part science and part practical. It keeps you involved in the world around you. It’s hard to be an economist without being interested in the world around you.”  <br />
> &mdash; Michael Spence

> "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."  <br />
> &mdash; Antoine de Saint-Exupery

> “If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.”  <br />
> &mdash; Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

> "Your brain really remembers only two things about an event: the emotional peak and the end. Structure events so that the peak is great and the ending is great. Make sure tomorrow has one thing that will be amazing and that it ends on a positive note."  <br />
> &mdash; Daniel Kahneman

> "Only by believing in and looking for secrets could you see beyond the convention to an opportunity hidden in plain sight. If insights that look so elementary in retrospect can support important and valuable businesses, there must remain many great companies still to start."  <br />
> &mdash; Peter Thiel

> "The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself."  <br />
> &mdash; Peter Thiel

> “Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement.”  <br />
> &mdash; Helen Keller

> "Invest in the process, not the outcome."  <br />
> &mdash; Srikumar Rao

> "And to my hero. That's who I chase. When I was 15 years old I had a very important person in my life come and ask me 'Who's your hero?' I said, 'I thought about it and it's me in ten years. So I turned 25 ten years later and that same person comes to me and goes, 'Are you a hero?' I said, 'Not even close!' She said why and I said, 'My hero is me at 35.' You see, every day, and every week, and every month, and every year of my life, my hero is always ten years away. I'm never going to be my hero. I'm not going to obtain that and that's fine with me because it keeps me with somebody to keep on chasing. So to any of us, whatever those things are and whatever it is we look up to, whatever it is we look forward to and whoever it is we're chasing, to that I say Amen. To that I say alright, alright, alright. And just keep living, huh? Thank you."  <br />
> &mdash; Matthew McConaughey

> “What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make.”  <br />
> &mdash; Jane Goodall

> "I would argue that nothing gives life more purpose than the realization that every moment of consciousness is a precious and fragile gift."  <br />
> &mdash; Steven Pinker

> "As I have said since my first shareholder letter in 1997, we make decisions based on the long-term value we create as we invent to meet customer needs. When we’re criticized for those choices, we listen and look at ourselves in the mirror. When we think our critics are right, we change. When we make mistakes, we apologize. But when you look in the mirror, assess the criticism, and still believe you’re doing the right thing, no force in the world should be able to move you."  <br />
> &mdash; Jeff Bezos

> "Fortune favors the bold."  <br />
> &mdash; Virgil, Aeneid X.284

> “I learned that almost as important as what I was doing was who I was doing it with. It really made a big difference.”  <br />
> &mdash; Hank Paulson

> “One only sees what one looks for. One only looks for what one knows.”  <br />
> &mdash; Goethe

> "Anything original comes from the unconscious."  <br />
> &mdash; John Cleese

> “It’s very, very difficult to chase after a wave. What’s better is to plant yourself in the middle of something you genuinely love, and then wait for the wave to come find you."  <br />
> &mdash; Jeff Bezos

> “A work of art is never finished. It is merely abandoned.”  <br />
> &mdash; E. M. Forster
